I graduated from [UNIL](http://unil.ch/index.html) in 2017, with a MSc in molecular life sciences with a specialization in bioinformatics. After a few months of travel, I came back to Lausanne where I started my PhD in human genomics and computational biology in [Prof. Jacques Fellay's lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/fellay-lab/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). More precisely, my research focuses on the interplay between human genetic variation, persistent infections and chronic inflammation, and their relevance for cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric morbidity. To assess these large-scale datasets, I mainly use statistical methods and bioinformatics tools.

***Keywords**: human genomics; persistent pathogens; humoral immunity; chronic inflammation; genome-wide association study; cardiovascular diseases; neuropsychiatric diseases*
